# Electric Vehicle Data Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes a dataset of electric vehicles (EVs) to uncover trends and insights regarding vehicle makes, models, electric utilities, and more. The analysis employs various data visualization techniques using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.

## Features

- Data Cleaning & Transformation: Prepares the dataset by handling missing values and unnecessary columns.
- Univariate Analysis: Explores individual categorical variables through descriptive statistics and visualizations.
- Bivariate Analysis: Investigates relationships between variables, including trends over time.
- Interactive Visualizations: Utilizes Plotly to create dynamic charts and maps for enhanced data exploration.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly
- Folium

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is contained in the file `Ev.csv`, which includes various attributes of electric vehicles, such as:

- Make
- Model
- Model Year
- Electric Range
- Electric Utility
- County
